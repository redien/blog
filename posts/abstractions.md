<!-- meta-data: {"title": "Building abstractions"} -->

The fundamental technique we use in software development is to use abstractions to reduce complexity.

##### What is abstraction?
Abstraction is quite fundamental to our thinking. As humans we use abstractions everyday, we talk about "walking" instead of "repeatedly putting a foot in front of the other alternating while at the same time leaning forward to gain momentum".

##### Leaky abstractions

##### What does it give us?

Write less by reuse.
```
var foo = ...;
var bar = foo + foo;
```
